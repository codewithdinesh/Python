# We can create shared attributes by placing them directly inside the class and not inside the constructor. And since this attribute is not owned by any one object, we donâ€™t need the self to create this attribute. Such variables which are created at a class level are called static variables. Here discount is a static variable.

class Mobile:
    discount = 50

    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

    # static variables are accessed by class name not by Object name
    def print(self):
        return Mobile.discount


mobile_obj = Mobile(1000, "apple")
print(mobile_obj.print())

# we can update static variables ,alse we can create getter setter of static varibles, we can also declare static variable as private variable .
