# when one object owns another object , but they have independent life cycle
# If class A owns class B, then class A is said to aggregate class B.
# and class A has all access of class B , But it can not access private member directly

# to create aggreation class , pass class object into the methods or constructor as a parameter of another class

# Sometimes a class may depend on another class for some of its use.
# This is not a strict relationship and hence wonâ€™t appear in the class diagram.
# For example, in the below code, the Customer class depends on a payment object for purchasing.
# Here payment is a local variable and not an attribute.
# If an object is used only in a method of a class as a local variable then it is called as Association
